# crypto-trader-diary-application

Web application designed with Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Maven. Main goal of doing this project is to learn some 
web development and technologies related to it with addition of doing something that will be usefull and helpfull for me.

Purpose of this application is to help with managing and controlling portfolio when trading 
alt-coins (every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin) with bitcoin. App gives us possibility to store information of all our
trades in one place and budget state including how much of our portfolio is frozen and free. Additionally application
provides some time predictions based on earlier results and budget states. Work still in progress.
